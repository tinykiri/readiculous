## About

Readiculous is a simple, clean book tracker. It’s a straightforward place to log your library, track your reading stats, and save your favorite quotes without any unnecessary clutter. The app uses a signature soft-pink and coral theme to keep the interface easy on the eyes while you manage your progress.

It’s built for readers who want a nice-looking way to stay organized and actually remember what they’ve read.
